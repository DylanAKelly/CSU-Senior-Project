# Windows Operating System Vulnerability Scanner

My project is a vulnerability scanner for modern Windows operating systems (Windows 10 & 11). The scanner will inform the user if there are any known vulnerabilities in the installed OS. The scanner will also check for vulnerabilities in the top 20 most popular applications if the user has them installed. The scanner will also check for any available updates for the OS or top 20 most popular applications. If any vulnerabilities or updates are found, the scanner will notify the user via email.
