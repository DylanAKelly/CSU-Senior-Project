## IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION SECTION

### PRODUCT

- **Product Name:** Windows OS and Application Vulnerability Scanner
- **Product Line Portfolio:** Cybersecurity

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this project is to create a free Windows vulnerability scanner that is capable of detecting when Windows OS or any of the top 20 most popular web apps are out-of-date. If the OS or any of the applications are found to be out-of-date, the program will notify the user of the security risks via email.

### TEST PERSONNEL

*Manual Test #14 is a special test case, as it will test the degree to which the program follows industry ethical standards. As such, a more detailed explanation of the test case is needed.

Manual Test #14 will verify that:

* A high standard of conduct and ethical practice is maintained

* The existing rules relating to professional work are respected

* The impacts and risks presented by the program are thoroughly evaluated

* The safety, helath, and welfare of the public is prioritized, and that the public's privacy is protected

* Unlawful conduct is avoided
  in accordance withe the [ACM](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) and [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html) Codes of Ethics.

The adherence to these ethical standards wil be assessed by way of an ethical analysis. I will review all facets of my program and determine the potential impacts on the user's privacy, safety, accessability, & data security and document my findings in an ethics self-assessment document. Additionally, I will review the findings of the ethics self-assessment document with someone who has more computer science ethics knowledge that I do to ensure that all potential impacts are accounted, handled ethically and do not violate the aforementioned ethical standards for which Manual Test #14 checks. 

## USER ACCEPTANCE TEST SECTION

Verify that the structure and "feel" of the program works for the user.

### USER ACCEPTANCE TEST STRATEGY

Due to the fact that the user acceptance tests will primarily test subjective criteria, an objective system must be made in order to accurately determine if the program passes the user acceptance tests. To this end, user satsifaction with dufferent factes of the program will be recorded using a survey. The user will fill ut this survey, rating each aspect of the program on a scale of one to five stars. In order to pass the tests, the average score for each section must be *at least* four stars.



The scenario that each user will follow in order to understand the program is as follows: 



The user will first download the program from my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DylanAKelly/CSU-Senior-Project/tree/master). Once the program has been downloaded, the user will run the program. Once the program is running, the user will be prompted for their email address. Initially, the user will be instructed to leave the email address blank or to enter an invalid email address. The user will then be instructed to read the error message and follow it's suggestions in order to enter their email address correctly. After the user has entered their email address correctly, they will need to start a vulnerability scan by pressing the "Scan OS and Apps" button that will appear after their email has been entered. Once the scan has been initiated, the user will need to wait for the scan to complete and for the results to be emailed to them. After the results have been emailed to the user, they will need to fill out [a survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScoWi8cTpF94qybYUCsWPixcO1aV0Mf02pu77P_-kiKGO8pqg/viewform?usp=sf_link) so that the program's subjective qualities can be turned into objective results.
